# Programming-Languages-Principles-and-Design

## Portfolios

The assessment in term 1 consists of completing a series of small problem solving exercises in range of programming languages, which will demonstrate understanding of the design, implementation and evaluation of the programming languages, and a short reflective essay on what on what has been learned from completing these exercises.

**Smalltalk/Pharo**

You will implement a simple system using Smalltalk’s object model, demonstrating use of Smalltalk message passing, instance variables and inheritance. You will develop the code in the Pharo environment which is typical of the Smalltalk dynamic image-based approach to creating software. 

**Python** 
You will implement a class in Python for processing text and generating statistics. The solution will make use of Python’s object model, accessor syntax, control structures and built-in container classes. 

 **JavaScript** 
 You will implement a system which queues Javascript functions. The solution will make use of JavaScript classes, anonymous functions/closures, flow control, accessor syntax and built-in collection classes. 

 **Lisp/Clojure** 
 You will implement a series of Clojure S-expressions to demonstrate the understanding of the List processing approach to programming as used by Lisp derived languages. 
 
**Haskell/Frege** 
You will implement a series of expressions to demonstrate a functional approach to problem solving and program construction. 

## Compiler

Your compiler will compile high-level code written in a language called Decaf, to unoptimized assembly code (GNU assembler) for an x64 Linux machine.
